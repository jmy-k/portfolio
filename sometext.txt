i wanted to create a tactile, tunnel-like experience for visitors, which at the same time would serve to hide the contents of the storage room. i hung large swathes of fabric from the ceiling, then draping and anchoring it in various points to create folds emulate movement. as the videos play, the moving leaves and birds would interact with the ripples of the fabric as well.

this installation required fabric that was thick enough to be opaque, but light enough to be hung securely. I decided on plain canvas to be hung up with jute strings. not only did canvas satisfy the requirements, but its coarse nature and wide fibers worked to invite touch. 

unfortunately, the gallery lacked a floor plan with measurements of the space, and given the irregular shape of the shelving and various furniture and objects placed in storage, it was difficult to take accurate measurements of the space. after drawing a rough sketch of the space, i determined that two bolts of canvas were needed from which 17 pieces, each 7 meters long, were cut. these pieces were sewn together lengthwise.
